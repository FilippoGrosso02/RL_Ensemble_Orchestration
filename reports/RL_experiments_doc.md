# Performing experiments to check the RL model learning capabilities

# The accuracy test

- Target: 100% accuracy

- Total_num_models = 5

- Num-Actions = 11

- List of models =  ["EfficientNetV2S", "DenseNet121", "ResNet50", "MobileNetV2", "NASNetLarge"]

Best performing models: 1. EfficientNetV2S, 2. Nas NETLarge

We want to check if overtime the model learns to include the models with the highest accuracy and discard the ones with less accuracy over time.
